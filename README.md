# My first full stack web ever!

## What I did so far, by order:

- Build a react app with template Typescript, it's named `front`.
- Integrate TailwindCss in the project React.
- Build a Nest app.
- Write a docker-compose.yml to build a database in Postgres.
- Add test_decorator: write custom decorator to understand better decorator in Nest.js and Typescript
- Write UserController, UserService to build a REST server with endpoints /users:id, users?role=value....
- Use Prisma to connect the server to database.
- Fetch data from backend to frontend (using Restful API), using fetch (or axios if not sure about the compatibility of browser)

## Upcoming works:

- [x] Build REST server with mock data.
- [x] Build REST server which connects to a database.
- [x] Connect REST server to FrontEnd, be able to fetch data from database.

- Build GraphQL server with mock data.
- Build GraphQL server which connects to a database.
- Connect GraphQL server to FrontEnd (React), be able to fetch data from database.

- Use Docker to build up everything at once.
